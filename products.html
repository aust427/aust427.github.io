        <p>
            A selection of various programming projects that I have developed and contributed to. These projects cover
            3D visualization, algorithm application, data science, and front-end development.

        <h2>Personal Spotify Data Analysis</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                An analysis of my personal Spotify playlist data as an attempt to create a song prediction algorithm using
                machine learning. Analysis was completed using Python and the Spotify API. Read more about the project here.

        <h2>Barnes-Hut Algorithm: 2D & 3D</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                An application built for applying the Barnes-Hut algorithm to an n-body simulation. Built in JavaScript using
                Three.js. See the 2D version here and the 3D version here.
            </p>

        <h2>Subhalo Particle Visualizer</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="images/data-products/sub-part-vis.jpg" alt="Subhalo Particle Visualizer" height="200" class="center">
            <p>
                An application built for visualizing and plotting subhalo particle data from the
                Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations. Utilizes a JavaScript front-end and a Python back-end.
                The main libaries used were Three.js, jQuery.js, and D3.js. See the code <a>here</a>. Is
                currently in-development.

        <h2>Astrosims</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                An online database used for hosting astronomical simulation data. Developed alongside Dylan Simon,
                PhD, and Elizabeth Lovero. Primary contributions include front end development, data visualization,
                and database management. See the website <a href="http://astrosims.flatironinstitute.org/">here</a>.

        <h2>Utah Teapot</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="images/data-products/utah-teapot.png" alt="Utah Teapot" height="200" class="center">
            <p>
                An interactive rendering of the Utah Teapot. Developed using JavaScript and the WebGL library. Includes
                a toggle between environment mapping and basic shading, as well as object and world rotations. See the 
                interactive example <a href="teapot/teapot.html">here</a>.
